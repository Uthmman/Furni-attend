/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is in prototyping mode and designed to be completely open for development purposes.
 * All read and write operations are currently allowed to unblock development and eliminate permission errors.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /employees/{employeeId}: Stores employee information.
 * - /employees/{employeeId}/attendance/{attendanceId}: Stores attendance records for each employee.
 * - /attendance/{date}/records/{employeeId}: Stores attendance records for a specific date.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All reads and writes are currently allowed (`allow read, write: if true;`).
 * - This is a temporary measure to facilitate rapid development and debugging.
 * - **WARNING: These rules MUST be replaced with more restrictive rules before production deployment.**
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Not applicable in this open prototyping mode.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Not applicable in this open prototyping mode.
